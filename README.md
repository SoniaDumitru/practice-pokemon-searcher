React Pokemon Searcher

React Code Challenge Practice

Project goals:
- create an index displaying pokemon 'cards'
- render each pokemon name, picture, and hp in a card
- when clicked, the card should toggle between displaying the front and back pictures
- allow users to search in order to narrow down the cards shown on the page
- wire up the form to add a missing pokemon (bulbasaur is missing, and you can probably intuit the image links to use based on the data you have). Since there aren't any validations, you may have to manually remove additions from the db.json file if you make a mistake on a post request, etc. When a new pokemon is added, -it should show on the page without having to refresh.

Project requirements:
components using state and props
re-renders based on client-side events
can both get data from, and post data to the json server/database
Trying to figure out where to start?
For the most part, the framework for this application is already made, with a simple json server, and a react app, with all the components needed. When you run npm start a json server will spin up and you can access the pokemon info at http://localhost:3000/pokemon, and your react application will also start, on port 3001. Given a list of deliverables, our goal is to navigate the existing code base and implement several new features. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the structure of the application, and think about where you will be making changes in order to implement the new features. While you could solve this lab without creating new components, or changing any existing ones to be functional components, you are encouraged to do so if it makes sense to do that at any point.
